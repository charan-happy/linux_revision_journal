# Interview Preparation Questions
Test your knowledge with these common interview questions for DevOps, SRE, and Cloud roles. Aim to answer them confidently, drawing from today's lesson:

1. **What is the Linux kernel, and how does it differ from a Linux distribution?**  
   (Hint: Focus on the kernel's role in hardware management vs. the distro's addition of user tools.)

2. **Explain kernel space vs. user space. Why is this separation important for system security and stability?**  
   (Hint: Discuss system calls and real-world implications like container isolation.)

3. **Name three popular Linux distributions and their typical use cases in a cloud environment.**  
   (Hint: Mention Ubuntu Server for general cloud, Alpine for containers, RHEL for enterprise.)

4. **How do package managers like apt and yum work? Why are they essential for DevOps workflows?**  
   (Hint: Cover repositories, dependency resolution, and automation benefits.)

5. **What is the role of the GNU Project in Linux? Why is the full name often "GNU/Linux"?**  
   (Hint: Explain userland tools like bash and ls.)

6. **Describe the open-source philosophy and how it benefits companies like AWS in their use of Linux.**  
   (Hint: Highlight freedom, collaboration, and transparency.)

7. **In a production SRE role, why might you prefer Linux over Windows for server infrastructure?**  
   (Hint: Reference stability, cost, and scalability from the comparison table.)

8. **How would you check the kernel version on a Linux instance, and why might a cloud provider use an older version?**  
   (Hint: Use `uname -r` and discuss stability/testing.)

Practice answering these aloud or in writingâ€”great for interview prep!

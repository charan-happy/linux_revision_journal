- **What is linux ?**
  - Linux is a free, open-source operating system kernel originally created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.
  - It forms the core of many Popular Operating Systems (called "distributions") such as ubunutu, centos and fedora
  - Linux is known for its stability, security and flexibility, which makes it the backbone of most servers and cloud infrastructure worldwide
  - It powers everything from webservers and cloud platforms to mobile devices and super computers

- **Why learn linux ?**
   - Essential for automation, scripting, troubleshooting and system administration in these modern digital world
   - In demand skill for all top tech jobs (Devops, SRE, Cloud, SystemEngineer etc) worldwide

# Exercises
1. Write down your personal goals for this course.
2. Join a Linux or DevOps online community (e.g., Reddit, Discord, LinkedIn group).
3. Set up your first Linux environment (online terminal, VM, WSL, or cloud instance).
4. Research and note down 3 ways Linux is used in the tech industry.
5. **Share your daily learnings publicly on social media (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) using hashtags `#linuxthefinalboss` and `#getfitwithsagar`. This helps you get noticed by recruiters and builds your professional brand.**

## Solutions
1. **goals:** 
- "Get a High paying DevOps job"
- "Automate tasks with Linux"
- "Understand cloud infrastructure"
- "Be Really very good at Linux".

2. **Recommended communities:**
   - **Course Discord:** https://discord.gg/mNDm39qB8t (Join for course support and discussions)
   

3. **Setup Instructions:**
   - **Online Terminal:** Try [KillerCoda](https://killercoda.com/) or [Play with Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/)
   - **VirtualBox:** Download VirtualBox + Ubuntu ISO → New VM → 2GB RAM → Install Ubuntu
   - **WSL:** Open PowerShell as Admin → `wsl --install` → Restart → Install Ubuntu from Microsoft Store
   - **AWS:** Launch EC2 → Ubuntu Server → t2.micro → Connect via SSH

4. **Linux usage examples:** Web servers (Apache/Nginx), cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes), automation (Ansible/Terraform), security testing (Kali Linux).
